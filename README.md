# Twitter API Clone

The **_Twitter API Clone_**, developed by Shahab Athar, is a complete replication of the functionalities of the original Twitter API. This API provides a robust platform for user interaction, content sharing, and social networking. It has **_JWT authentication with rolling access and refresh tokens_**, allowing users to register, login, and reset passwords. Users can **_authenticate with username and password_**. Users can **_manage their profiles, follow or unfollow others, and search for users by various criteria_**. The API supports creating **_tweets, replying to tweets with nested replies, and bookmarking tweets_** for future reference. Additionally, users can create and manage **_Twitter lists_** to curate groups of users for targeted content viewing. Additionally, there is an **_admin panel_** for managing users and overseeing the platform. The **_API comprises of 36+ endpoints_** covering a wide range of functionalities, enhancing user interaction and engagement. Future enhancements include the introduction of community features and real-time messaging using Django Channels, aiming to provide an enriched social media experience.

cp .env.template .env

python
```

Generate the secret in python using **secrets** module. Feel free to use any other method or library.

```py
# Generate the secret key
import secrets
secrets.token_hex(32)
```

Now copy the output to your **SECRET_KEY** variable in your **.env**
